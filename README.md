# machineLearning_1

y = w0 + w1 * x1 + w2 * x2

SSE loss function is used to train the machine learning model.

student.py is the main file used to train the machine learning model.

--data is the path of the data csv file.
--eta is the learning rate for the loss function.
--threshold is used to stop the training process. It stops the training when the difference of consecutive errors is less than the threshold.
